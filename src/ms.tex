Figure~\ref{fig:mandelbrot} was automatically generated using \texttt{showyourwork} with minimal instructions from the user.
By labeling the figure with \verb+\label{fig:mandelbrot}+, the user informs \texttt{showyourwork} that there exists a script in the \texttt{figures} directory called \texttt{mandelbrot.py} that generates the figure files included within that \texttt{figure} environment.
This behavior can be changed or overridden by specifying custom rules in the \texttt{Snakefile}.

% A sample figure
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \begin{centering}
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{mandelbrot.pdf}
        \caption{
            This figure is included as \texttt{mandelbrot.pdf}; we drop
            the \texttt{figures/} path since this is included in a single
            call to \texttt{graphicspath} at the top of the manuscript.
        }
        % This label tells showyourwork that the script `figures/mandelbrot.py'
        % generates the PDF file included above
        \label{fig:mandelbrot}
