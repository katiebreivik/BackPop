# Backward Population Synthesis: Mapping the Evolutionary History of Gravitational-Wave Progenitors

An open source scientific article created using the [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) workflow.

One promising way to extract information about stellar astrophysics from
gravitational wave catalogs is to compare the catalog to the outputs of stellar
population synthesis modeling with varying physical assumptions.  The parameter
space of physical assumptions in population synthesis is high-dimensional and
the choice of parameters that best represents the evolution of a binary system
may depend in an as-yet-to-be-determined way on the system's properties.  Here
we propose a pipeline to simultaneously infer zero-age main sequence properties
and population synthesis parameter settings controlling modeled binary evolution
from individual gravitational wave observations of merging compact binaries. Our
pipeline can efficiently explore the high-dimensional space of population
synthesis settings and progenitor system properties for each system in a catalog
of gravitational wave observations.  We apply our pipeline to observations in
the third LIGO Virgo Kagra Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog. We showcase the
effectiveness of this pipeline with a detailed study of the progenitor
properties and population synthesis settings that produce mergers like the
observed GW150914.  Our pipeline permits a measurement of the variation of
population synthesis parameter settings with binary properties, if any; we
present inferences for the recent GWTC-3 transient catalog that suggest that the
stable mass transfer efficiency parameter may vary with primary black hole mass.

## Data Release

[Link](https://zenodo.org/record/6624911#.YqM2oWDMKUk) to zenodo data repo. Note that showyourwork will fetch the data from zenodo the first time you build the document, which could take a while to download ~5GB of data.
